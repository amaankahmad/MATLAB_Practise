Design a function M-file MyDifferentiation with input variables Fx and XValue
which numerically calculates the first derivative of f(x) at x = XValue by using the
First Principle. The program should include a routine which starts with a step size
of h = 1, and decreases h by an order of magnitude until a precision of four significant figures is reached. 
The function should output the final step size and value of the first derivative. Test your program by evaluating a known 
first derivative of a function of your choice.
