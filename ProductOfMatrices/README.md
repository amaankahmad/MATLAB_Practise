Use for loops to design a function M-file Myproduct(A,B) which returns the product of two matrices A and B (for this exercise, 
you are not allowed to use any MATLAB matrix or vector multiplication commands). The function should checkwhether the 
dimensions of the matrix are suitable for multiplication and return anerror message if they are not. Test your results by 
multiplying three pairs of random matrices of various sizes using your routine and the built-in MATLAB matrixmultiplication 
(you can write a script M-file for this purpose if you want to).
